# Urban Science and Sustainability

![Screenshot](/images/Urban4.1_.jpg)

Bhartendu Pandey is an Alvin M. Weinberg Fellow at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. His research examines urban areas using multiple lenses (including land use, infrastructure, economic activity, and human mobility) to understand their sustainability implications. He uses big data (satellite remote sensing, GIS, national surveys, and social media)—complemented with ground knowledge and fieldwork—to ask and answer compelling questions facing urban science.  Specifically, he is interested in the human health and sustainability implications of urban infrastructure. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences from the University of Delhi, a Master of Science in Geoinformatics from the TERI School of Advanced Studies (then TERI University), and a PhD from Yale University.
