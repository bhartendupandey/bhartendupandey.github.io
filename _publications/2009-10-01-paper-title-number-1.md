excerpt: "Urban expansion is one of the major drivers of agricultural lands loss. However,
current remote sensing-based efforts to monitor this process are limited to small
scale case studies that require much user input. Given the rate and magnitude of
contemporary urbanization, there is a need to develop a land change algorithm
that can characterize the loss of agricultural land at large scales over long time
periods. Moreover, characterizing agricultural land conversion trajectories from
remote sensing images is complex due to farm size, climatic variability, changes
in cropping patterns, and variations in the rate of development processes. Here we
propose an econometric time series approach to identify agricultural land loss due
to urban expansion, utilizing high temporal frequency MODIS NDVI data
between 2000 and 2010. The algorithm is comprised of two main components: 1)
detrending the time series, and 2) testing for the presence of a breakpoint in the
detrended time series and estimating the date of the breakpoint. Evaluations of the
algorithm with simulated and actual MODIS NDVI data confirm that the method
can successfully detect when and where urban conversions of agricultural lands
occur. The algorithm is simple, robust, and highly automated, thus is valuable for
monitoring agricultural land loss at regional and even global scales."
